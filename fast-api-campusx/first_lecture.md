# FAST API – CAMPUSX

## 🌐 FastAPI & APIs for Machine Learning  

### 🎯 Why FastAPI Matters
- Crucial for AI/ML careers: enables exposing models to users.  
- 99% of ML models are shared via APIs.  
- FastAPI is used by 9/10 companies for scalable, industry-grade APIs.  
- Goal: Learn to build APIs for ML/DL/Generative AI and deploy them.

## 🔑 What is an API?
- **Definition**: A connector enabling communication between two software components (front-end ↔ back-end).  
- **Protocols**: Typically HTTP.  
- **Data Format**: JSON (universal, language-independent).  
- **Analogy**:  
  - Customer = Front-end  
  - Kitchen = Back-end  
  - Waiter = API  
  - Menu = Rules/protocols  
  - Plated food = Data format

## 🏗️ Problems Solved by APIs

### 1. Pre-API Era (Monolithic Architecture)
- Front-end & back-end tightly coupled → hard to share data.  
- Example: IRCTC train booking site couldn’t share data with apps like MakeMyTrip.  
- **Solution**:  
  - Decouple back-end.  
  - Add API layer with endpoints (e.g., `/trains`).  
  - External apps can access securely.  
  - Revenue opportunities via integrations.  

### 2. Smartphone Revolution
- Need for multiple front-ends (web, Android, iOS).  
- Monolithic approach → duplicate codebases, high cost, sync issues.  
- **Solution**:  
  - Single database + single back-end.  
  - Expose via API.  
  - Multiple front-ends (web, Android, iOS) connect through API.  
  - Simplified, scalable architecture (used by Google, Uber, Zomato).

## 🤖 APIs in Machine Learning
- Core component = ML model, not database.  
- **Example: ChatGPT**  
  - Model trained → exposed via API → website/app integration.  
- Pre-API ML apps: monolithic (front-end + back-end tightly coupled).  
- Problem: Couldn’t easily expose model to other platforms.  
- **FastAPI solves this**: makes ML models accessible, scalable, and deployable.
